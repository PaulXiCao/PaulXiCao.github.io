<p>I recently installed a unix system with virtualbox and after reboot it woudnt start at all - no output..</p>
<p>I started a live cd and reinstalled grub. worked like a charm.</p>
<p>link for reinstallation of grub: <a href="https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?20559-How-To-Repair-Kali-Linux-Grub-With-Kali-Linux-Live-Cd-Dual-Boot-With-Windows-7">link</a></p>
<p>in case some crazy error pops up (<code>Warning:Failed to connect to lvmetad. Falling back to device scanning.</code>), I also made some host-run directory available in the chroot. just follow this link: <a href="https://www.pckr.co.uk/arch-grub-mkconfig-lvmetad-failures-inside-chroot-install/">link</a></p>
