<p>types (int,long,..) often vary in size and therfore one uses <span style="text-decoration:underline;">standard types: qtypes_t</span> where q is a qualifier, type is the base type, s is the width in bits and _t is an extension so you know you are using the C99 defined types (e.g., uint8_t)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">negative binary number</span> representations:</p>
<ol>
<li>sign bit: one bit is specialized as a sign bit</li>
<li>one's complement:
<ul>
<li>"not" operator applied to positive number yields neg. number</li>
<li>advantage: subtraction is easy (just add and also add additional carry over bit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>two's complement:
<ul>
<li>same as one's comp. but you always add an additional one</li>
<li>advantag: subtraction is even easier (just add) and all simple math op. are now easy to manage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
