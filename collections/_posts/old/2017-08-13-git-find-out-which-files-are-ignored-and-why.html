<p>i had a very large global ignore list (tex/vim/linux/python specific stuff) and in this one repo git didnt add one specific folder. as it turned out the global ignore list blocked it.</p>
<p>to figure out which files are ignored:<br />
[code language="bash"]<br />
$ cd &lt;git-folder&gt;<br />
$ git ls-files --others -i --exclude-standard<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>and to figure out why one specific folder/file is ignored issue:<br />
[code language="bash"]<br />
$ git check-ignore &lt;path&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>
