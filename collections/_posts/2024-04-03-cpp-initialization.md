C++ is infamous for its overly complex initialization processes.
It is even worse than one would anticipate (with basic knowledge of the language).
There is [a flowchart](https://randomnetcat.github.io/cpp_initialization/initialization.png) showing all the different possibilities.
It is ~130Mio pixels!?!?
This is just crazy.
