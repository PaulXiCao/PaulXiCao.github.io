The book ["Rust in Action" by Tim McNamara](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) is widely recommended online as a good and basic learning resource for Rust.

It explains basic rust concepts by walking through multiple smaller projects (e.g. file manipulation, networking, and kernel-level programming).
This helps in showing usecases for those concepts but at the expense of being not feature dense or very thorough. 

With regards to my personal context (experienced C++ developer with little time to spare) I would not recommend it as the chapters were too long for the insight that I gained.
Rating: 5/7 ;)
