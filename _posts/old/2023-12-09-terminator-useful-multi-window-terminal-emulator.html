<p>one can set terminator up to start with pre-defined layout and terminals. important distinction: layout defines where and how a window should be setup and a profile defines which programs should run (e.g. initial working directory for bash).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>at first define profiles for each different initial working directory.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>then setup layout and select the appropriate profile for each. (just clicking custom command/working directory in layout did not work for me.)</p>
